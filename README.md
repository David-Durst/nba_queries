# NBA Queries
This directory contains queries on NBA data's spatio-temporal data sets of players positions during games. 
The queries are implemented in multiple languages so that I can better understand the performance of these systems.
From this understanding, I'm hoping to find a set of acceleration structures and query semantics that a single system
to answer all these queries with low latency and high throuhgput. 

## Code
This repository contains queries implemented in three languages: 
1. [C++](src/cpp)
2. [Q (for KDB)](src/q)
3. [SQL (for PostgreSQL 13)](src/sql)

## Theory
